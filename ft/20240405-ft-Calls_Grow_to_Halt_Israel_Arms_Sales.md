Pressure rose yesterday for the government to halt arms sales to Israel after the killing of seven aid workers, including three Britons, in an air strike in Gaza. Three former Supreme Court justices joined more than 600 jurists and dozens of Labour MPs in signing a letter to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, warning that the UK risked breaking international law over a "plausible risk of genocide" in Gaza if it did not stop its weapons exports to Israel.

Sir Alex Younger, former head of MI6, joined a chorus of criticism from senior Conservative figures, including the MP Mark Logan and Lord Nicholas Soames, telling the BBC yesterday that "insufficient care is being paid [by Israel] to collateral risks".

The bulk of Britain's arms exports go to the Gulf, notably to Saudi Arabia, with sales to Israel relatively small compared with countries such as France, Germany, and Italy. They, in turn, are dwarfed by the US, which accounts for the bulk of Israeli weapons imports.

The UK has sold arms with a value of more than £574mn to Israel since 2008, with exports amounting to £42mn in 2022 - compared with a global export total of £70.6bn that year, according to analysis of government data by the group Campaign Against Arms Trade.

The main exports to Israel in 2022 and 2023 were parts for aircraft and military radar systems, according to CAAT, but the group said the UK arms licensing regime "lacks transparency" and it was "impossible" to know the full value.

Britain also supplies around 15 percent of the F-35 fighter aircraft, which is built in the US by Lockheed Martin and used by the Israeli military. CAAT estimates that given Britain's share of the program, the value of UK parts in the F-35s delivered to Israel has been "£336mn since 2016".

CAAT said that ending arms exports would "send a clear message that the UK believes that Israel is breaching international humanitarian law, which would put pressure both on the Israeli government and also on the US".

Lord Ian Austin, the prime minister's trade envoy to Israel, warned that a ban on arms sales to Israel might end up damaging the UK. "The impact on Israel would be negligible but a reciprocal move against Britain would be much more significant because much more equipment, and vital intelligence, comes the other way," he said.

BAE Systems, which builds the rear fuselage section of the F-35 at its factory in Samlesbury in Lancashire, said it had "no operations or employees in Israel or Gaza, nor do we sell military equipment directly to Israel".

The UK subsidiary of Italy's Leonardo makes the "advanced targeting laser" for the F-35 at a site in Edinburgh. Leonardo UK declined to comment.

The UK subsidiary of Israel's defense contractor, Elbit Systems, has been a target of arms protesters for several years. It employs more than 600 people in Britain and is an established supplier to its armed forces, including for the army's Watchkeeper drone program.

Elbit's Israeli parent builds the Hermes 450 drone used in the strike that killed the aid workers, according to arms campaigners, who allege its UK subsidiary, UAV Engines, supplies the engines. The UK unit denied being involved in the Hermes program.

The government did not respond to requests for comment.
